# MatrixOperationsEncryption
The first Encryption.py script uses matrix operations and other mathematical functions in order to encrypt a message into an secret format. The program uses one specifc message to begin: "WHEN PLAN A FAILS, REMEMBER THERE ARE 25 OTHER LETTERS IN THE ALPHABET". After several steps such as encoding using a chart, matrix multiplication, and modulus division, and ecrypted message is created. 

# MatrixOperationsDecryption
The second Decryption.py script is able to replicate the exact steps that created the encypted message in the first place. However, the order of the steps are flipped. After the encrypted message was created using the first script, the second file is able to take that exact code and decipher its meaning. The program was able to take the encrypted message "HPK6/.?C8QA$O0Q(UQ?R5@C75%A1T3V#%HA$13O?V@21B)1D5 \7#%@I)XT3R3OWRTP#AIHV" and convert it back to its original message: "WHEN PLAN A FAILS, REMEMBER THERE ARE 25 OTHER LETTERS IN THE ALPHABET"
